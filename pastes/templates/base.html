                    <p>Before pasting anything to this it is important to know the possible security risks.</p>
                    <p>This application was designed with the assumption that it would be run on an at home homelab with no ingress from the internet. Some basic </p>
                    <p><strong>All pastes are stored in plaintext:</strong>This means that if someone had direct access to the database the values could be retrieved easily.</p>
                    <p><strong>Only your user can see your pastes:</strong>Except for the above caveat, other users logged into this service can not see other users pastes.</p>
                    <p><strong>Risk Mitigation:</strong> To mitigate the risk of seeing data with direct access to the database the following is implemented:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>When a paste expires it is not simply marked as expired in the database but is fully deleted.</li>
                        <li>Pastes expire 30 minutes after creation</li>
                        <li>The expiration time can be extended in 30 minute intervals, but it cannot be extended if the time is already an hour or more later. 
                            <ul>
                                <li>Said another way, the time can go above an hour if the time remaining was 45 minutes and you extended. It would become an hour and 15 minutes, but it would not allow you to extend again until the time is under an hour.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Note on deletion:</strong> Due to how deletion works, there is a small window between its expiration time and when the record actually deletes. Until the record is deleted it will continue to show instead of being hidden. If a record is still showing for more than 5 minutes something went wrong and should be reported.</p>
